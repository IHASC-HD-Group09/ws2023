## Exercise 1 *Pointer Chasing*

### a)
- What happens in the main experiment?  

The main experiment runs a loop `s` times, which is the current stride. Inside that we run a while loop where we access the array at the current index `i`, starting at `i=0` and then set the index `i` to the value at that position. This is repeated until the index is `0` again.  
Essentially, we follow pointers in the array, starting at `0` and ending at `0` again, but with a stride of `s`.

- What is the purpose of the empty experiment and why do we measure its time?  
  
The purpose of the empty experiment is to measure the overhead of the for/while loops themselves, such that we can subtract it from the main experiment and get the actual cache access times.

- Why do we include the loop ``for (int k=0; k<s; k++)``?  

The higher our stride `s` the less array elements we access, so we run the experiment `s` times to overall access the same amount of elements for each stride.
